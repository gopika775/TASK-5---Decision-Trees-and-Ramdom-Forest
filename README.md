# TASK-5---Decision-Trees-and-Ramdom-Forest

Heart Disease Classification Project

This project applies Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict the presence of heart disease using the Heart Disease dataset.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Performed

- Imported and explored the dataset (heart.csv)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn
- Visualized the Decision Tree structure
- Analyzed overfitting by adjusting max_depth and plotting accuracy vs depth
- Trained a Random Forest classifier and compared its performance to the Decision Tree
- Interpreted feature importance using barplots
- Evaluated both models using:
  1. Accuracy
  2. Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
  3. Cross-validation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries Used

-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-sklearn

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Output

A trained and evaluated pair of models — one using a single Decision Tree, the other using a Random Forest ensemble — to classify patients as having heart disease or not. Visualizations include the decision tree plot, accuracy vs depth graph, and feature importance barplot. Cross-validation scores are also included to assess generalization.
